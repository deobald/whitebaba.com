        <p>Welcome to The White Baba. This is my Personal Bible.</p>
        <p>This isn't really anything, other than a gentle reminder to myself of guidelines I've constructed while of sound mind, in a state of lucidity I may not always be in. These guidelines are not rules, but there's probably little reason to break them. These guidelines are not for everyone but the idea of a Personal Bible may be. If I ever met you, maybe I would encourage you to write your own.</p>

        <h2>1. Brush your teeth</h2>
        <p>Teeth are the viruses of all the calcium material in your body. Not really alive, not really dead. They don't heal themselves and their existence is largely descent into their eventual decay and demolition. Treat them well. Brush every morning (preferably before anything else), floss, and rinse with moouthwash. On approach of slumber, repeat for air unseen and prevention of smolder.</p>
